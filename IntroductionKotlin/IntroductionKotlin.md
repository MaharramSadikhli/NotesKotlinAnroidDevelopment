# Introduction to KOTLIN

## What is KOTLIN?

> KOTLIN is a **statically typed, general-purpose programming language** rapidly gaining traction in the tech industry. Renowned for its **conciseness, readability, and safety features**, it's no surprise that over 60% of professional Android developers now leverage its prowess for building **robust and high-performance mobile applications**. As of 2019, Google has made KOTLIN the first choice for Android development.

## KOTLIN Basics

> Having explored the vast potential of KOTLIN, let's take a closer look at its fundamental characteristics that make it such a compelling choice for developers.
> 


✅ **Statically Typed, Dynamically Delightful:** KOTLIN enforces **type safety** by explicitly defining the data types of variables. This helps catch errors early, leading to more robust and predictable code. However, don't be fooled by the "static" label. KOTLIN allows for **type inference**, where the compiler can automatically deduce types based on context, keeping your code clean and concise.



✅ **Object-Oriented Odyssey:** While functional features shine, KOTLIN doesn't forget its object-oriented roots. You can create classes, inherit from them, and utilize interfaces for polymorphism.



✅ **Interoperability Maestro:** Worried about switching from your current language? Fear not! KOTLIN seamlessly integrates with Java code, allowing you to gradually adopt it or leverage existing libraries. This smooth transition makes it an attractive choice for teams considering a gradual shift.




✅ **Functional Flair:** Embracing the power of functional programming, KOTLIN provides features like **lambdas** and **higher-order functions** to write elegant and concise code. This encourages a declarative style, focusing on what you want to achieve rather than the "how" of achieving it.

✅ **Conciseness is King:** Say goodbye to boilerplate code! KOTLIN emphasizes readability and expressiveness. Features like **null safety** eliminate the need for tedious null checks, and **extension functions** add functionality to existing classes without modifying their code. The result? Code that's easier to write, understand, and maintain.
